-> TypeScript is JavaScript with added syntax for types.
-> This basically means that TypeScript adds syntax on top of JavaScript, allowing developers to add types.

Why should I use TypeScript?

-> JavaScript is a loosely typed language. It can be difficult to understand what types of data are being passed around in JavaScript.
-> TypeScript allows specifying the types of data being passed around within the code, and has the ability to report errors when the types don't match.
-> TypeScript uses compile time type checking. Which means it checks if the specified types match before running the code, not while running the code.

TypeScript Simple Types:

boolean - true or false values
number - whole numbers and floating point values
string - text values like "TypeScript Rocks"

Type Assignment:

    -> Explicit Type : writing out the type
    -> Implicit - TypeScript will "guess" the type, based on the assigned value

Special Types :
    
    -> any
    -> unknown
    -> never
    -> undefined
    -> null
    -> never
    -> undefined & null
    -> Arrays : 
        - Ex. const names: string[] = [];
        - readonly
    -> Tuples
        - Typed Arrays : A tuple is a typed array with a pre-defined length and types for each index
        - Readonly Tuple
        - Named Tuples
        - Destructuring Tuples
